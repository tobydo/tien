Tien: Jun… I don’t know. 
Jun: What do you mean you don’t know?! I’ve been waiting for months. I apologized! What else do you want from me?!
Tien: I don’t know Jun, I’m sorry, I just can’t… 
Jun: You’re really going to choose your dumbfuck autistic brother over me?
Tien: He’s right there! This is exactly why this can’t work out!
Jun: Oh I’m sorry I just want you to live your life instead of being a babysitter forever.
Tien: We’re done talking. 
Jun: You know what? This is good. I wouldn’t want my kids to end up being like him. 
Tien: Just leave Jun.
Jun: … Fine. Have fun with your retard brother.
Tien: I’m sorry.
Duc: Are you okay?
Tien: I’ll be fine, are you OK?
Duc: I’ll be fine. Do you wanna grab some food before the tournament?
Tien: Yeah, that sounds good.
